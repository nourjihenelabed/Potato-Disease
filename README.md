# Potato Disease Classification (CNN)

This project focuses on detecting diseases in potato plants using deep learning.  
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with TensorFlow to classify potato leaf images into three categories:

- **Healthy**
- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**

The goal is to automate disease identification from images and support early diagnosis in agriculture.

## Project Overview

Plant diseases significantly affect crop yield and food security. Manual inspection is slow, subjective, and not scalable.  
This project applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to classify potato leaf images accurately.

The model learns visual patterns from labeled images and predicts the disease class for unseen samples.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of potato leaf images categorized into:
- Healthy
- Early Blight
- Late Blight

> ⚠️ The dataset is **not included in this repository** due to size constraints.  
> You must provide the dataset locally and ensure it follows the expected directory structure.
> Which can be found on Kaggle
